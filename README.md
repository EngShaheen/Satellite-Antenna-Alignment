# Satellite-Antenna-Alignment

This program was made as an assignment for Satellite communication, under the aupervision of dr. Mahmoud Selim
the department of communcation and electronics engineering, Faculty of engineering, Tanta University.

This was developed by:

Eng\ Ahmed Shaheen

Eng\ Mohamed El-Demerdash

(Our first program ^_^)

Abstract:

We have developed an easy gui software that help the user to compute Antenna alignment parameters and determine the angles for any satellite.
Program features:
1.	Ask the user to input the following data: satellite name, type, position, user geographic coordinates, satellite orbital parameters, operating frequency and antenna dish size
2.	Allows the user to get his position coordinates from google map.
3.	Contains a database of all GeoStationary satellitesâ€™ names and positions to allow the user to choose from them.
4.	Restrict the user from inputting invalid data format (allows only float numbers).
5.	Calculate the satellite look angles, declination angle, distance and round trip time.
